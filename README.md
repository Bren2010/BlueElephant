Blue Elephant
=============
 Blue Elelephant aims to be a simple no *BS* straight forward MVC like web 
framework. Emphasis on _MVC like_ as we purposefully ommit the M in MVC from
this framework to get out of the way of developers.

Why no model system?
--------------------
 Where not against model systems. We find them outstanding for niche purposes.
However, we find them annoying and counterproductive when used as blanket 
paradigms. So instead we simply leave it up to the end developer wether to use
models are not and how to go about it.
